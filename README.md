# Seoul Bike Sharing Demand Forecasting

## Project Overview

This project aims to predict the demand for bike sharing services in Seoul based on various factors such as weather conditions, time of the year, and other relevant variables. The predictions can help in managing the bike fleet more efficiently and improving user satisfaction by ensuring bikes are available when and where they are needed. this project using the dataset from the [Seoul Bike Sharing Demand](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/560/seoul+bike+sharing+demand) provided by UCI ML repository.

## Features

- Data Cleaning: The dataset was rigorously cleaned to ensure accuracy in the models. This involved handling missing values, removing outliers, and converting data types appropriately.

- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Initial analysis to understand the trends and patterns in the data which include daily, monthly, and seasonal trends in bike usage.

- Predictive Modeling: Several machine learning models were trained to forecast bike sharing demand. The models were evaluated to select the most accurate one.

- Visualization: Developed insightful visualizations to represent the data analysis and model results effectively, aiding in intuitive understanding and decision-making.

## Usage
To run the analysis and view the forecasts:

1. Ensure you have Jupyter Notebook installed.
2. Open the Seoul_Bike_Sharing_demands.ipynb notebook.
3. Run the cells sequentially to see the analysis process and results.
